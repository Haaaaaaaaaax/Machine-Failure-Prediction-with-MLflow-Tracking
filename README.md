# Machine Failure Prediction with MLflow Tracking

This project implements a machine learning solution for predicting machine failures using sensor data. The implementation includes comprehensive data analysis, preprocessing, and model training with advanced tracking and optimization capabilities.

## Project Overview

The project follows a structured approach to machine failure prediction:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Comprehensive analysis of sensor data
   - Feature understanding and visualization
   - Data quality assessment

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Data cleaning and normalization
   - Feature engineering
   - Data transformation for model training

3. **Model Training and Optimization**
   - PyTorch-based model architecture
   - MLflow integration for experiment tracking
   - Optuna for hyperparameter optimization
